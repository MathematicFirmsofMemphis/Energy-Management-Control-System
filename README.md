Another next gen way to float similar to star citizen. This would have various visuals and relies not on fossil fuels but pyrotechnics as fuel! and not as propulsion
The stunning visuals of using pyrotechnic materials as fuel is overwhelming compared to levitation and antigravity in space drones.
The design of pyrotechnics can occur from chemcad or etc or even 3d software if a file format is made for applied pyrotechnics and turned into fuel sources similar to coal burning or sparklers burning
 for starters to expel energy not create thermaldynamics.
